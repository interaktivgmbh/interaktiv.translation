# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Machine translations of content without a workflow get the status
  `machine_without_review`.
- Breaking: an existing working copy is never overwritten, not even with
  `overwrite`; the translation is refused with 409.
- Breaking: `GET @translate` answers `languages` (with `machine` per
  language) instead of `target_languages`; on a multilingual site only site
  languages are offered.
- The machine translation marker and the `machine_translation` expander
  include `source_language`.

## 1.0.0a1 (2026-10-14)

- Initial public release.
